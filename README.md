Actually this package has an eventually support and sometimes was difficult to install in certain distros.

Here you can find:
- An AppImage ponyprog2000 package, built from source(pure 64-bit).
- A standalone ponyprog2000 binary.
- A recipe to build everything.
- Patched sources.
- An old deprecated AppImage(needs i386-arch support in your distro, not recommended).
- An old deprecated tarball with old Fedora/Mandriva/Suse/RedHat libs(suitable for 32-bit machines or 64-bit machines with i386-arch enabled, not recommended).
